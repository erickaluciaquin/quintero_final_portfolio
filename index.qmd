**Ericka Quintero** is a rising senior at California State University, Monterey Bay, where she majors in Marine Science with a minor in Data Science. Her academic journey began at Saint Mary's College in Notre Dame, Indiana, before she transferred to CSUMB to further explore her passion for oceanic studies and data analysis.

In 2022, Ericka gained hands-on experience in childhood education and coastal monitoring as a camp counselor at YMCA Camp Surf. Driven by her deep love for animals, she dedicated an entire summer to volunteering at Vet Point Vet Hospital in her hometown of Mexicali, Mexicoâ€”an invaluable opportunity to immerse herself in the veterinary field.

This year, she continues her commitment to youth education and outdoor learning by returning to YMCA at Camp Campbell, where she looks forward to expanding her skills and experiences.
