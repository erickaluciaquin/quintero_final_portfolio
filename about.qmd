title: "About Me"
---

Hello! My name is Ericka Quintero, and Iâ€™m a rising senior at California State University, Monterey Bay, majoring in Marine Science with a minor in Data Science. I was born in El Centro, California and raised in a family of six in the hot desert of Mexicali, Mexico, which allowed me to be a fluent bilingual of English and Spanish at a young age.

I am a proactive and progress-driven individual who focuses on the quality of the work and "making" things happen.
